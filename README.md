# A Novel Framework for Spatiotemporal Monitoring and Post-Signal Diagnosis of Processes with Image Data
Farzad Amirkhani ,Amirhossein Amiri

The spread of emerging technologies and advances in measuring devices has led to an increase in the amount of data obtained from manufacturing systems in recent years . For instance, the use of sensors and machine vision systems in the manufacturing companies has led to a massive amount of data, which extracting information from this data and exploiting them effectively is one of the most fundamental challenges of data science and statistical process control.  
The codes in this repository are presented to monitor image data based on control charts and to estimate the change point in case of receiving an out-of-control alarm which are related to paper entitled **A Novel Framework for Spatiotemporal Monitoring and Post-Signal Diagnosis of Processes with Image Data**. A comprehensive discription of codes and the obtained results are presented in the github page addressed [here](https://fzdamirkhani.github.io/qrei_2019/).
